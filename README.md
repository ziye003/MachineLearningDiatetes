# MachineLearningDiatetes

This is a machine learning study on diabetes

Performed cox regression and logistic regresstion for feature selection. Determined if a clinical feature and/or a biomarker can potentially be risk or protective factors for
diabetes development.

Used a selected list of blood biomarkers to predict the risk of developing diabetes. SVM, RandomForest, Logistic regression, and XGBOOST are used to predict whether diabetes 
will occur. The ROCAUC score is 0.95.
Linear regression and XGBoost are used to predict time required to develope diabetes. MSE around 7.

Used K means clustering and Hierachial clustering to identify clusters of diabatic patients. Both clustering algorithms generated similar results. Demonstrated result in PCA and tSNE. Identified top blood biomarkers that
contributed to the clustering.
